# Instagram Login Page Clone
This is a frontend project built to practice and improve my web development skills. 
Itâ€™s a clone of Instagram's login page, designed with a focus on HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and responsive web design principles. 
The goal was to replicate the page's layout, style, and responsiveness, and clean, maintainable code.
